How to use :\
Currently, some of Jamecore's functionalities are not accessible to the general public. You can log in if you have a spotify account, but it will not add the playlist and songs to your account.
To use this application and access all its features, you need to get in touch with me directly at tessrezard@gmail.com . I can then add you as an authorized user on the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

I have made a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjLoCkVbMQU) for this project which you can find here:
